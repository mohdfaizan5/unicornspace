        <p class="content-solution">
          Most technical founders have strong familiarity with bottoms-up sales. They download open source packages all
          the time, and adopted Github or PagerDuty or Stripe through word of mouth. What many founders have not seen
          directly is how well a repeatable sales engine can work.

          If resistance comes from your team versus you, explain to them that your goal as a company is to build
          something great. To build something at scale, you will need to get big companies to adopt your product (even
          more people can use it!), that all the companies your employees use and admire actually have sales forces, and
          that sales at its best can provide insights that would be more challenging to get otherwise (see below)
