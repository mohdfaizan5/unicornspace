## blog3 : 10 things for a startup to go

there's no single factor that makes a startup succeed it's actually many things have to go right at the exact same time for you to end up being a successful company it's like the Anna Karina principle right where all the successful houses look similar but all the failed households all fail in their own ways so what I've done in this video is I've taken my own personal knowledge my own personal 10-year long startup experience and I've compressed it into 

10 points 10 points where I think if you get these 10 points in order you have the maximum shot of success ready here goes the first thing to get right is 


1. Hiring 
  hiring see whether you're selling software or whether you're selling fizzy drinks essentially it's still a bunch of people with a cool idea who work on the execution of that idea it's still people who generate the software it's still people at least today it's still people who generate the software it's still people who come up with these products so what you have to do is get the absolute best people and get as few of them as possible but most importantly you have to keep them aligned if somebody has a good attitude even if that person does not have the skills they will eventually pick up that attitude the attitude of curiosity the fit with whatever culture you have for example if you're a team that has the values of working very hard you wouldn't want to hire somebody who only wants to work two hours a day they're probably better places for that person to work than to suffer at your company and for you to suffer with that person it's a two-way street now when it comes to culture a lot of Founders let it happen inorganically like oh you know let's put 10 people in a room and see what happens and sometimes that does that does happen but once you get Beyond a few number of people you you need to codify your culture which means you need to write it down and repeat it hundreds of times if you want to learn more about culture there's actually a book by Tony hisaya about delivering happiness go check it out when we at Avalon hire people today we tend to put them through two rounds of interviews where the first round of interview is a culture round where we see if they fit with us they align with our values and the second round is the technical round where we actually look into their skills we put the culture around first because we want to know if we align so that we're not wasting their time or our time good culture is like building a house made of concrete versus bad culture is like building a house made of paper if a fire goes out in some part of your house the house of concrete will stand but if a fire goes out in a house of paper each piece of paper will transmit the fire to the next piece so with the bad culture if something bad happens like wildfire it'll spread very quickly and all your employees will end up making it worse very is if you have a house of concrete you will survive the second point and this is the point that comes after you hire people is your Product ability to build a product that people really want the word I like using is oxygen product and oxygen is what humans require to breathe without oxygen we die so whatever solution you are giving your users or your customers it has to be something they cannot live without they need to be tearing their hairs knocking at your door asking for your help the worst place to be and I've been there before is to be a product that nobody really wants or something that's lowest on somebody's priority stack people think that once you hit product Market fit which is that you're able to sell a product somebody's paying money for it and they keep renewing that is good enough but in 2022 I think with so much noise it is important for you to be critical into somebody else's workflow either for a business you need to be critical or let's say if you're a single mother and your pipe breaks down having somebody being a able to come home and fix it for you is an oxygen need it's not something you can do yourself so products that solve those sort of needs that's a burning desire for someone have a higher likelihood of succeeding the founder of superhuman Rahul Vora has a great article about product Market fit and building oxygen products I'm going to link to all the resources we've spoken about in this video in the description so don't forget now because we're an informational Channel and I try to give you as much data as possible I'm going to give you three thumb rules for different kinds of businesses for example if you are a consumer business let's say you're an app you need to make sure you have at least 20 retention at month 3. in d2c businesses your total lifetime value which is the amount of money a customer spends on you across all his purchases on your website or on your product needs to be more than your acquisition cost for that customer and ideally you want to make sure that each customer purchases your product multiple times usually mostly to see businesses which is direct to Consumer businesses let's say like Mama Earth lose money on their first order if you're building software if you're building software as a service you need to make sure you have at least less than 10 percent churn Chun means people leaving your product and going away so who stop paying for your product you need to make sure it's under 10 per year in fact I'm going to tell you a personal story eight years ago I remember pitching my product job Spire at that time to a VC called Excel and a partner in Excel called priyank I still have a picture of that event and I remember Priyanka that event told me the metrics I should be hitting because until then I was all thinking about vision and what I'm supposed to build and all the cool stuff all the Jazz that Founders tell you in the media but priyank gave me numbers he told me these are the targets you need to hit now today those numbers are very different and Excel which is the fun that priyank works for is actually one of India's largest investors and they have put out a series called seed to scale in fact every year the best series award goes to different different people and this is an award I made up just now but Axel definitely deserves the award this year for their seat to scale series it has a lot of founder collections where they speak to different different Founders and they ask those Founders their experiences and try to codify it as best as possible into metrics so if you want to know how swiggy succeeded or what the problems they faced what metrics they try to hit or how Urban clubs succeeded or what the metrics they needed go check out the seat to scale series I'm going to link to it in the description below now why do I recommend this because this series features founders of companies like spinny like swiggy like Urban clap like myntra Founders who've been there and done that Founders who explain their insights their metrics their philosophies why something worked Why didn't it work so go check it out because hey who better to learn from than people who have actually made it to that scale to venture scale the next thing and this is going to seem a little bit weird is that the market actually Market matters far more than your product idea you could have a great idea in a really terrible market and get nowhere you could be the best founder in a very small market and get a small chunk of the outcome or you could be an average founder in a fantastic market and still get a very big chunk of the outcome Kunal Shah says this very well right he says that it's like building dams if you build a dam where water doesn't flow if you build a dam on a desert for example there is no point so you need to find a very fertile place with a lot of water flowing through to build your Enterprise in fact the Axel C2 scale series you'll see that a lot of these Founders started with an idea and an understanding of that market and then tried three or four product combinations one by one by one until they fit in a particular Market in fact many of these companies today are marketplaces for example swiggy and spinny they're all marketplaces and they are now in the process of creating a market and allowing other entrepreneurs smaller entrepreneurs to capture parts of that opportunity the next thing is Passion that a startup often succeeds only when the founder is passionate I've run out of steam many times in my life I've been doing this for 10 years and whenever I run out of steam the growth of the company hits the floor right it doesn't move as fast as it used to so I feel like passionate Founders are willing to go through any setback they're willing to take lower salaries they're willing to go five years without you know any major successes they're willing to see their friends make 10 times more money than them because they love what they're doing they would do it even if they were not paid they would do it even if they didn't raise funding so being passionate is often something that VCS look for when your capitalists look for and it's something you need to be very sure of damn sure of before you step into doing something if you do something and you're not passionate about it you might not quit today but you'll quit two years or three years or 10 years later so you need to be obsessed with something and that's the only way to make it work Point number five is that your chance of Multiple Founders startup success increases as you go from one co-founder to two co-founders three co-founders is fine as well four is also okay anything beyond four also becomes problematic the reason a single co-founder situation doesn't work is because you have nobody to converse with and like I said a startup is a roller coaster some days are awesome some days are horrible for example we had two very bad weeks this month and then in the third week we closed a hundred thousand dollar ARR deal which me and my co-founders celebrated together so we celebrate the lows and the highs together or rather we don't celebrate the lows we just absorb it with each other the second thing is that my co-founder today abhinav test me and so do I if I feel like he's saying something that I'm not so sure of or vice versa we talk it out we say are you sure about that and it's a good way to keep our cognitive biases in check because as a single founder you can't just be misled by your own thoughts and your vision because the minute you raise VC Capital you you think you're God for a short period of time there is no one to test your assumptions because you just got a major win so you might think that hey everything I do from now on is going to be a win and having somebody to keep you in check is a good thing even companies like Oracle and Facebook that we attribute to one founder actually had more than one but in general having multiple Founders is a good thing right it's more people to study the ship right imagine if you're going on a voyage and going on a voyage is the spirit of being a startup that's why it's called Venture Capital the word Venture comes from Adventure imagine going on that ship alone it's not fun so get these people along have fun with them and the spirit of not letting each other down can be a great motivator the next thing is you Banked need to make sure you are well banked you at least have the money in the bank for the kind of problem you are going to solve now last year we had a lot of companies that had raised too much money and the problem with that is sometimes these companies may not achieve product Market fit and then they just have a lot of capital on their hand and they just burn it on random things but on the flip side having too little money is a problem as well because if you truly figured out product Market fit then if you are competing in a competitive market somebody else can raise more money than you hire your talent run the ads get in front of customers build a better experience for their end customer so you need to make sure you are armed with some sort of watches for the stage of company that you are in not having Flexible liquid cash can sometimes slow down your growth the next thing is that some Founders are just not flexible you see they say that well Steve Jobs never compromised on his ideas why should I well if you've actually read Steve Jobs's biography you'll realize that he made several mistakes one of the first instances of the MacBook cost him twenty thousand dollars per piece it wasn't sustainable at all so even he's made his own mistakes and he's ended up pivoting so the right statement is persistent Sun Cost Fallacy about the problem but flexible about the solution you should really care about the problem in the market and you should be willing to try three or four different ideas or three or four different products attacking the market from slightly different angles if the first or the second one doesn't work some Founders are so stuck with that idea that sometimes what they end up doing is they look at the ideas that they worked on in the last couple of months and say well I've put all my time and all my energy in that let me continue that instead of trying a new route this is called the sun cost fallacy you've put time you put energy you put money in that and you say that I'm going to continue along that path because I've already done all that but the market does not care all the market cares about is you putting out something that they really want to pay for or that they would be willing to change their behavior for that's it everything else is not counted including the three four years of work that you might have put in the past I know in assignments in exams we get step marking but in the real world there is no step marking it does not matter what you've done until you get that once success so on the flip side it doesn't matter if you wasted many years if you find the one magic fit that is all it is that is where the inflection point takes place the next User Feedback thing is that successful startups talk to their users sometimes as Founders unless we have faced the problem ourselves which is a good thing if you face to prom yourself then you are the user you can avoid a little bit of user talking even then I don't recommend it you should always be talking to your users if you don't talk to your users if you're building in isolation then you truly don't know what they want and you can save a lot of time a lot of code a lot of energy on building something that nobody wanted in the first place the more users you talk to and honestly that is the hard part building is not the hard part not anymore especially with open source and all the advancements that humans have made over the last few years that's not the hard part talking to users putting yourself out there shamelessly asking for feedback that is something a lot of Founders think they're above we are not above that I still ask for a lot of your feedback and whenever people write some stuff in the comments sometimes they take that feedback and incorporate it into my next video and paradoxically the bigger you get the more feedback you take the more your years become open in your mouth shuts so listening to user feedback is something that no founder is above you should be doing it no matter the stage of the company that you're at number Fear of Sales nine is fear of sales a lot of Founders today who are funded are technical in nature they're very good at building things and they don't talk to users which we spoke about on the last point but they're also afraid of asking for money there's a great blog post by Ellard Gill where he talks about the fear of sales he says that slack and zoom a lot of their revenue hasn't come from small businesses it has come from large Enterprises where there's a lot of talking involved we as Founders we think the dream is you put a site up people come they pay by themselves and you make money right it happens automatically but that almost never happens in reality you have to to do a lot of talking and a lot of selling especially as you sell larger contracts so this fear of sales should be avoided we should not be afraid of going to an Enterprise talking to them and converting them right that should be something that we as Founders do now in college we simply never sell we never ask our friends for money right and if we ask our friends for money it's somewhat seen as a bad thing but if you want to do business you have to learn how to ask for money to defend and justify why you're asking for that kind of money and if nobody pays you well then you don't have product Market fit then maybe you should evaluate whether what you're building is something that is necessary and you'll realize there is nothing wrong about charging people for the value that you're providing to them it's something a lot of us as Indians have to unlearn so that we can go out and charge money so that our team our operations our product can become even better finally and the last point is Timing that it's all about timing all the other nine points that I spoke about you have to do them in a very specific order you have to do them at exactly the right time and in exactly the right ratio you can't end up spending too much of your time fundraising or too much of your time on product and not talking to users you have to learn when to do what and when these inflection points change because the best way to become successful is to learn from other people's stories and make sure you identify whether you're in that point of the story at today's date and one of the best resources for that is to actually go check out Excel seat to scale series it's free you learn a lot about these Founders and their inflection points and it's something I've been obsessed with so definitely go check it out that's it for me bye
