What you need:
1/ Clear target audience - to get max returns
2/ Optimised profile - to gain trust
3/ Excel sheet - to track the data
4/ Calendly link - to book calls



3 Steps to follow:



STEP - 1) Send a personalised connection note to your active target clients.

Send 100/ Week

Find them in the 'post reaction' section of the top creators in their industry.

---> They'll view your profile

Make sure that you have:

- Clear picture and banner
- Updated featured section
- A bio that tells about your work
- Contents directed towards them

Your presentation and work speaks louder than your follower count.

If you lose here, you lose clients.



STEP - 2) If they accept, they come to your DM.

Normally, 40-50 would accept in a Week.

Now, Introduce yourself in short with a message.

You can start with:

'"Thank you for connecting, name"
or "Glad to connect with you, name"

- Keep it short
- Reach out like a human
- Show interest in their growth

Don't sound needy or salesy.

Keep the message open ended and ask for their permission to sell.

I usually end with this:

"Is there a way I can help you?"
or "Would you be interested in discussing this?"



STEP - 3) If they say yes, congrats!

- Send the Calendly link
- Get on a call
- Close them

BUT being honest, 80% of them won't respond to your msg (My stats)

Reason:
They are busy
They don't need your help
They are just not sure about it

It's okay, It doesn't mean they are not interested.



Most important step --> Follow up

Real business is in these msgs.
Keep your ego aside and send atleast 2 follow ups.

• You can send a guide
• Engage with their posts
• Send a super personalised msg

(You can talk about their experience, recent post, compliment a habit they have etc)

By doing this, you can expect a minimum of 5-10 people coming on a call with you per week.

There's always room for improvement in msgs that you write.



Remember: Outbound is a numbers game.

More outreach > more DMs > more calls > more business

- Go strong at it
- Track your data in excel
- Double down on what worked

You'll have a crazy business growth in just a month.
