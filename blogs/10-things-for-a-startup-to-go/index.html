        <h2>How to make a startup successful</h2>
        &nbsp;
        <p>
          One of the most critical factors that can significantly impact the success of a startup is the quality of the
          team.
          Over the years I've realized that there's no single factor that makes a startup succeed, it's actually many
          things have to go right, at the exact same time for you to end up being a successful company.
          So I think if you get these 10 points in order, you will be having the maximum shot of success. Let's get
          started.

        <h2>1. Hiring</h2>
        &nbsp;

        <div class="list">
          <div>
            <p>
              Hiring the right people can make all the difference. If you can get the absolute best
              people and get as few of them as possible but most importantly you have to keep them aligned. Pick up the
              people that have the attitude of curiosity and can fit with every culture.
            </p>

              Good culture is like building a house made of concrete versus bad culture is like building a house made of
              paper. If a fire goes out in some part of your house the house of concrete will stand but if a fire goes
              out
              in a house of paper each piece of paper will transmit the fire to the next piece. So with the bad culture
              if
              something bad happens like wildfire it'll spread very quickly and all your employees will end up making it
              worse.

        <h2>2. Build a product the people really want.</h2>

          <div>
            <p>
              The point that comes after you hire people is - to build a product that people really want. The word I
              like using is oxygen product and oxygen is what humans require to breathe, without oxygen we die. So
              whatever solution you are giving to your users or your customers, it has to be something they cannot live
              without. They need to be tearing their hairs knocking at your door asking for your help.
            </p>
            &nbsp;

            <p>
              The worst place is to be a product that nobody really wants or something that's lowest on somebody's
              priority stack. Three thumb rules for different kinds of businesses, for example if you are

            <ul>
              &nbsp;
              <li class="lists">
                <span>
                  Consumer business -
                </span>
                and building an app you need to make sure you have at least 20 retention at month 3.
              </li>
              &nbsp;
              <li>
                <span>
                  D2C business -
                </span>
                the amount of money a customer spends on you across all his purchases on your website or on your product
                needs to be more than your acquisition cost for that customer and ideally you want to make sure that
                each customer purchases your product multiple times.
              </li>
            </ul>

              You could have a great idea in a really terrible market and get nowhere and you could be the best founder
              in a very small market and get a small chunk of the outcome. Or you could be an average founder in a
              fantastic market and still get a very big chunk of the outcome.
            </p>
            &nbsp;

            <p>
              Successful startups focus on identifying a substantial market opportunity before developing their product.
              They seek to understand the size of the market, its growth potential, and the competition within it.
              Investors and stakeholders are often more interested in the market than the product itself. They want to
              know that the market is large enough and viable for the startup's success.

        <h2>4. When the founder is passionate</h2>
        &nbsp;

        <div class="list">
          <div>
            <p>
              When a founder is deeply passionate about their venture, it becomes a driving force that propels the
              business forward. Passion fuels the determination to overcome obstacles, the energy to work tirelessly,
              and the unwavering commitment to achieving the startup's mission.
            </p>
            &nbsp;

            <p>
              Passionate Founders are willing to go through any setbacks, they're willing to take lower salaries,
              they're willing to go five years without any major successes because they love what they're doing and they
              believe in it.
              If you do something and you're not passionate about it you might not quit today but you'll quit two years
              or three years or 10 years later. So you need to be obsessed with something and that's the only way to
              make it work.

        <h2>5. Your success will increase with multiple Founders</h2>
        &nbsp;

        <div class="list">
          <div>
            <p>
              With a team of founders, the workload is distributed, allowing each member to focus on their areas of
              expertise. Diverse perspectives are another significant benefit of multiple founders. Each founder brings
              a unique set of skills, experiences, and viewpoints to the table. This diversity can lead to more creative
              problem-solving and innovation.
            </p>
            &nbsp;

            <p>
              The reason a single founder situation doesn't work is because you have nobody to converse with and like I
              said a startup is a roller coaster, some days are awesome and some days are horrible. Embrace the journey,
              for it's in the mix of good and bad that true success stories are written.
